# Rails Cookies Everywhere

A collection of projects aiming to help developers use their [**Ruby on Rails**](https://github.com/rails/rails) authentication cookies in other apps.

Available languages/platforms:
- [NodeJS](https://github.com/rails-cookies-everywhere/rails-cookies-nodejs)
- [Rust](https://github.com/rails-cookies-everywhere/rails-cookies-rust)

## Decrypting cookies

| Language   | Rails 5 | Rails 6 | Rails 7 |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| JavaScript | ✅      | ✅       | ❌      |
| Rust       | ✅      | ✅       | ✅      |

## Encrypting cookies
The JavaScript library can encrypt cookies for Rails, but it's ill-advised.
